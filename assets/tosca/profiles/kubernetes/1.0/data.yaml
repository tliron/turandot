          Must be greater than zero. The primary sort is based on VersionPriority, ordered
          highest to lowest (20 before 10). Since it's inside of a group, the number can
          be small, probably in the 10s. In case of equal version priorities, the version
          string will be used to compute the order inside a group. If the version string
          is "kube-like", it will sort above non "kube-like" version strings, which are
          ordered lexicographically. "Kube-like" versions start with a "v", then are
          followed by a number (the major version), then optionally the string "alpha" or
          "beta" and another number (the minor version). These are sorted first by GA >
          beta > alpha (where GA is a version with no suffix such as beta or alpha), and
          then by comparing major version, then minor version. An example sorted list of

    description: CSIDriverSpec is the specification of a CSIDriver.
    properties:
      attachRequired:
        description: >-
          attachRequired indicates this CSI volume driver requires an attach operation
          (because it implements the CSI ControllerPublishVolume() method), and that the
          Kubernetes attach detach controller should call the attach volume interface
          which checks the volumeattachment status and waits until the volume is attached
          before proceeding to mounting. The CSI external-attacher coordinates with CSI
          volume driver and updates the volumeattachment status when the attach operation
          is complete. If the CSIDriverRegistry feature gate is enabled and the value is
          specified to false, the attach operation will be skipped. Otherwise the attach
          operation will be called. This field is immutable.
        type: boolean
        required: false
      fsGroupPolicy:
        description: >-
          Defines if the underlying volume supports changing ownership and permission of
          the volume before being mounted. Refer to the specific FSGroupPolicy values for
          additional details. This field is alpha-level, and is only honored by servers
          that enable the CSIVolumeFSGroupPolicy feature gate. This field is immutable.
        type: string
        required: false
      podInfoOnMount:
        description: >-
          If set to true, podInfoOnMount indicates this CSI volume driver requires
          additional pod information (like podName, podUID, etc.) during mount operations.
          If set to false, pod information will not be passed on mount. Default is false.
          The CSI driver specifies podInfoOnMount as part of driver deployment. If true,
          Kubelet will pass pod information as VolumeContext in the CSI
          NodePublishVolume() calls. The CSI driver is responsible for parsing and
          validating the information passed in as VolumeContext. The following
          VolumeConext will be passed if podInfoOnMount is set to true. This list might
          grow, but the prefix will be used. "csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.name": pod.Name
          "csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.namespace": pod.Namespace "csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.uid":
          string(pod.UID) "csi.storage.k8s.io/ephemeral": "true" if the volume is an
          ephemeral inline volume defined by a CSIVolumeSource, otherwise "false"
          "csi.storage.k8s.io/ephemeral" is a new feature in Kubernetes 1.16. It is only
          required for drivers which support both the "Persistent" and "Ephemeral"
          VolumeLifecycleMode. Other drivers can leave pod info disabled and/or ignore
          this field. As Kubernetes 1.15 doesn't support this field, drivers can only
          support one mode when deployed on such a cluster and the deployment determines
          which mode that is, for example via a command line parameter of the driver. This
          field is immutable.
        type: boolean
        required: false
      requiresRepublish:
        description: >-
          RequiresRepublish indicates the CSI driver wants `NodePublishVolume` being
          periodically called to reflect any possible change in the mounted volume. This
          field defaults to false. Note: After a successful initial NodePublishVolume
          call, subsequent calls to NodePublishVolume should only update the contents of
          the volume. New mount points will not be seen by a running container. This is a
          beta feature and only available when the CSIServiceAccountToken feature is
          enabled.
        type: boolean
        required: false
      storageCapacity:
        description: >-
          If set to true, storageCapacity indicates that the CSI volume driver wants pod
          scheduling to consider the storage capacity that the driver deployment will
          report by creating CSIStorageCapacity objects with capacity information. The
          check can be enabled immediately when deploying a driver. In that case,
          provisioning new volumes with late binding will pause until the driver
          deployment has published some suitable CSIStorageCapacity object. Alternatively,
          the driver can be deployed with the field unset or false and it can be flipped
          later when storage capacity information has been published. This field is
          immutable. This is a beta field and only available when the CSIStorageCapacity
          feature is enabled. The default is false.
        type: boolean
        required: false
      tokenRequests:
        description: >-
          TokenRequests indicates the CSI driver needs pods' service account tokens it is
          mounting volume for to do necessary authentication. Kubelet will pass the tokens
          in VolumeContext in the CSI NodePublishVolume calls. The CSI driver should parse
          and validate the following VolumeContext:
          "csi.storage.k8s.io/serviceAccount.tokens": { "<audience>": { "token": <token>,
          "expirationTimestamp": <expiration timestamp in RFC3339>, }, ... } Note:
          Audience in each TokenRequest should be different and at most one token is empty
          string. To receive a new token after expiry, RequiresRepublish can be used to
          trigger NodePublishVolume periodically. This is a beta feature and only
          available when the CSIServiceAccountToken feature is enabled.
        type: list
        entry_schema: TokenRequest
        required: false
      volumeLifecycleModes:
        description: >-
          volumeLifecycleModes defines what kind of volumes this CSI volume driver
          supports. The default if the list is empty is "Persistent", which is the usage
          defined by the CSI specification and implemented in Kubernetes via the usual
          PV/PVC mechanism. The other mode is "Ephemeral". In this mode, volumes are
          defined inline inside the pod spec with CSIVolumeSource and their lifecycle is
          tied to the lifecycle of that pod. A driver has to be aware of this because it
          is only going to get a NodePublishVolume call for such a volume. For more
          information about implementing this mode, see
          https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/ephemeral-local-volumes.html A driver can
          support one or more of these modes and more modes may be added in the future.
          This field is beta. This field is immutable.

          command to the storage system to attach a volume to a specific node, it can use

          (e.g. "company.com/zone", "company.com/region"). When a driver is initialized on
          a node, it provides the same topology keys along with values. Kubelet will
          expose these topology keys as labels on its own node object. When Kubernetes
          does topology aware provisioning, it can use this list to determine which labels
          it should retrieve from the node object and pass back to the driver. It is
          possible for different nodes to use different topology keys. This can be empty
          if driver does not support topology.

          "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client": issues client certificates that can be
          used to authenticate to kube-apiserver. Requests for this signer are never
          auto-approved by kube-controller-manager, can be issued by the "csrsigning"
          controller in kube-controller-manager. 2.
          "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet": issues client certificates that
          kubelets use to authenticate to kube-apiserver. Requests for this signer can be
          auto-approved by the "csrapproving" controller in kube-controller-manager, and
          can be issued by the "csrsigning" controller in kube-controller-manager. 3.
          "kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving" issues serving certificates that kubelets use to
          serve TLS endpoints, which kube-apiserver can connect to securely. Requests for
          this signer are never auto-approved by kube-controller-manager, and can be
          issued by the "csrsigning" controller in kube-controller-manager. More details
          are available at
          https://k8s.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/#kubernetes-signers
          Custom signerNames can also be specified. The signer defines: 1. Trust
          distribution: how trust (CA bundles) are distributed. 2. Permitted subjects: and
          behavior when a disallowed subject is requested. 3. Required, permitted, or
          forbidden x509 extensions in the request (including whether subjectAltNames are
          allowed, which types, restrictions on allowed values) and behavior when a
          disallowed extension is requested. 4. Required, permitted, or forbidden key
          usages / extended key usages. 5. Expiration/certificate lifetime: whether it is
          fixed by the signer, configurable by the admin. 6. Whether or not requests for
          CA certificates are allowed.

          Once populated, this field is immutable. If the certificate signing request is
          denied, a condition of type "Denied" is added and this field remains empty. If

          label, contain no headers, and the encoded data must be a BER-encoded ASN.1
          Certificate structure as described in section 4 of RFC5280. 3. Non-PEM content
          may appear before or after the "CERTIFICATE" PEM blocks and is unvalidated, to
          allow for explanatory text as described in section 5.2 of RFC7468. If more than
          one PEM block is present, and the definition of the requested spec.signerName
          does not indicate otherwise, the first block is the issued certificate, and
          subsequent blocks should be treated as intermediate certificates and presented
          in TLS handshakes. The certificate is encoded in PEM format. When serialized as

      spec. They must be added via the pod's ephemeralcontainers subresource, and they

      IngressRule represents the rules mapping the paths under a specified host to the

          Host is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC
          3986. Note the following deviations from the "host" part of the URI as defined
          in RFC 3986: 1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only
          apply to the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress. 2. The `:` delimiter is not
          respected because ports are not allowed. Currently the port of an Ingress is
          implicitly :80 for http and :443 for https. Both these may change in the future.
          Incoming requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue. If
          the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes all traffic based on the specified
          IngressRuleValue. Host can be "precise" which is a domain name without the
          terminating dot of a network host (e.g. "foo.bar.com") or "wildcard", which is a
          domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. "*.foo.com"). The

          only a single label. You cannot have a wildcard label by itself (e.g. Host ==
          "*"). Requests will be matched against the Host field in the following way: 1.
          If Host is precise, the request matches this rule if the http host header is
          equal to Host. 2. If Host is a wildcard, then the request matches this rule if
          the http host header is to equal to the suffix (removing the first label) of the

          completion is homologous to each other. `Indexed` means that the Pods of a Job
          get an associated completion index from 0 to (.spec.completions - 1), available
          in the annotation batch.kubernetes.io/job-completion-index. The Job is
          considered complete when there is one successfully completed Pod for each index.
          When value is `Indexed`, .spec.completions must be specified and
          `.spec.parallelism` must be less than or equal to 10^5. This field is
          alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable the IndexedJob feature
          gate. More completion modes can be added in the future. If the Job controller

          that parallelism is limited to 1 and the success of that pod signals the success

          If a Job is suspended after creation (i.e. the flag goes from false to true),
          the Job controller will delete all active Pods associated with this Job. Users
          must design their workload to gracefully handle this. Suspending a Job will
          reset the StartTime field of the Job, effectively resetting the
          ActiveDeadlineSeconds timer too. This is an alpha field and requires the
          SuspendJob feature gate to be enabled; otherwise this field may not be set to

          being deleted, its lifecycle guarantees (e.g. finalizers) will be honored. If
          this field is unset, the Job won't be automatically deleted. If this field is

          in Assigned. Assigned only updates in the status after the record has been
          checkpointed to disk. When the Kubelet is restarted, it tries to make the

          payload associated with Spec.ConfigSource, attempting to load or validate the
          Assigned config, etc. Errors may occur at different points while syncing config.
          Earlier errors (e.g. download or checkpointing errors) will not result in a
          rollback to LastKnownGood, and may resolve across Kubelet retries. Later errors
          (e.g. loading or validating a checkpointed config) will result in a rollback to
          LastKnownGood. In the latter case, it is usually possible to resolve the error
          by fixing the config assigned in Spec.ConfigSource. You can find additional
          information for debugging by searching the error message in the Kubelet log.
          Error is a human-readable description of the error state; machines can check
          whether or not Error is empty, but should not rely on the stability of the Error

          becomes the LastKnownGood config when the node determines that the Assigned
          config is stable and correct. This is currently implemented as a 10-minute soak
          period starting when the local record of Assigned config is updated. If the
          Assigned config is Active at the end of this period, it becomes the
          LastKnownGood. Note that if Spec.ConfigSource is reset to nil (use local
          defaults), the LastKnownGood is also immediately reset to nil, because the local
          default config is always assumed good. You should not make assumptions about the
          node's method of determining config stability and correctness, as this may
          change or become configurable in the future.

      Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient
      marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64()
      accessors.

      The serialization format is:

      <quantity> ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
       (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
      <digit> ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9 <digits> ::= <digit> | <digit><digits> <number> ::=
      <digits> | <digits>.<digits> | <digits>. | .<digits> <sign> ::= "+" | "-"
      <signedNumber> ::= <number> | <sign><number> <suffix> ::= <binarySI> |
      <decimalExponent> | <decimalSI> <binarySI> ::= Ki | Mi | Gi | Ti | Pi | Ei
       (International System of units; See:
      http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
      <decimalSI> ::= m | "" | k | M | G | T | P | E
       (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
      <decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> | "E" <signedNumber>

      No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a
      number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal
      places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m
      will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger
      or smaller quantities.

      When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it
      had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.

      Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that
      Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or
      decrease in Mantissa) such that:
       a. No precision is lost
       b. No fractional digits will be emitted
       c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
      The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.

      Examples:
       1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
       1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"

      Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point
      number. That is the whole point of this exercise.

      Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will
      be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't
      diff.)

      This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without
      writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause
      implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

          to shuffle the list of queues and deal a hand of the size specified here. The
          request is put into one of the shortest queues in that hand. `handSize` must be
          no larger than `queues`, and should be significantly smaller (so that a few

          MaxUnavailable is 0. Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding

          most 30% of the total number of nodes that should be running the daemon pod
          (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled) can have their a new pod created before the
          old pod is marked as deleted. The update starts by launching new pods on 30% of
          nodes. Once an updated pod is available (Ready for at least minReadySeconds) the
          old DaemonSet pod on that node is marked deleted. If the old pod becomes
          unavailable for any reason (Ready transitions to false, is evicted, or is
          drained) an updated pod is immediatedly created on that node without considering
          surge limits. Allowing surge implies the possibility that the resources consumed
          by the daemonset on any given node can double if the readiness check fails, and
          so resource intensive daemonsets should take into account that they may cause
          evictions during disruption. This is an alpha field and requires enabling

          topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with

          restoring from snapshot or capacity tracking are needed, c) the storage driver
          is specified through a storage class, and d) the storage driver supports dynamic
          volume provisioning through a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource
          for more information on the connection between this volume type and
          PersistentVolumeClaim). Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific

      service:
        description: >-
          `service` is a reference to the service for this webhook. Either `service` or
          `url` must be specified. If the webhook is running within the cluster, then you
          should use `service`.
        type: ServiceReference
        required: false
      url:
        description: >-
          `url` gives the location of the webhook, in standard URL form
          (`scheme://host:port/path`). Exactly one of `url` or `service` must be
          specified. The `host` should not refer to a service running in the cluster; use
          the `service` field instead. The host might be resolved via external DNS in some
          apiservers (e.g., `kube-apiserver` cannot resolve in-cluster DNS as that would
          be a layering violation). `host` may also be an IP address. Please note that
          using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as a `host` is risky unless you take great care
          to run this webhook on all hosts which run an apiserver which might need to make
          calls to this webhook. Such installs are likely to be non-portable, i.e., not
          easy to turn up in a new cluster. The scheme must be "https"; the URL must begin
          with "https://". A path is optional, and if present may be any string
          permissible in a URL. You may use the path to pass an arbitrary string to the
          webhook, for example, a cluster identifier. Attempting to use a user or basic
          auth e.g. "user:password@" is not allowed. Fragments ("#...") and query
          parameters ("?...") are not allowed, either.
