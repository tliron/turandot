      CSIStorageCapacity stores the result of one CSI GetCapacity call. For a given
      StorageClass, this describes the available capacity in a particular topology
      segment. This can be used when considering where to instantiate new
      PersistentVolumes.

      For example this can express things like: - StorageClass "standard" has "1234
      GiB" available in "topology.kubernetes.io/zone=us-east1" - StorageClass
      "localssd" has "10 GiB" available in "kubernetes.io/hostname=knode-abc123"

      The following three cases all imply that no capacity is available for a certain
      combination: - no object exists with suitable topology and storage class name -
      such an object exists, but the capacity is unset - such an object exists, but
      the capacity is zero

      The producer of these objects can decide which approach is more suitable.

      They are consumed by the kube-scheduler if the CSIStorageCapacity beta feature
      gate is enabled there and a CSI driver opts into capacity-aware scheduling with
      CSIDriver.StorageCapacity.

          size that may be used in a CreateVolumeRequest.capacity_range.required_bytes
          field to create a volume with the same parameters as those in

      CertificateSigningRequest objects provide a mechanism to obtain x509

          Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an
          identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the
          list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list
          can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order. Order
          is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
          finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the
          finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which
          the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a
          signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component
          responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without
          enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not
          vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.
